/** 
 * This is an example that demonstrates how to extend the library using your own
 * Bankable MIDI Output Elements. 
 * The example declares a MIDI Output Element that sends MIDI Note events when a
 * push button is pressed or released. It can be banked to change the MIDI 
 * address. It's a simplified version of the @ref Bankable::NoteButton class.
 * 
 * To understand this example, you need to understand the @ref Bank.ino and the
 * @ref Custom-MIDI-Output-Element.ino examples first.
 *
 * @boards  AVR, AVR USB, Due, Nano 33 IoT, Nano 33 BLE, Teensy 3.x, ESP32
 * 
 * Connections
 * -----------
 * 
 * - 5: momentary push button (to ground) to send MIDI notes
 * - 6: momentary push button (to ground) to select the next bank
 * 
 * The internal pull-up resistors for the buttons will be enabled automatically.
 * 
 * Behavior
 * --------
 * 
 * - When the button on pin 5 is pressed, a MIDI Note On message is sent for
 *   note C in the octave determined by the bank setting.
 * - When the button on pin 5 is released, a MIDI Note Off message is sent for 
 *   note C in the octave determined by the bank setting.
 * - When the button on pin 6 is pressed, the bank setting is incremented.
 * 
 * Mapping
 * -------
 * 
 * Select the Arduino as a custom MIDI controller in your DAW, and use the 
 * MIDI learn option to assign the button to a function.

/*
 * Compare this class with the class in the Custom-MIDI-Output-Element.ino 
 * example.
 * 
 * You'll notice that the constructor argument `bankConfig` was added to specify
 * the bank to use.
 *  
 * The `address` member variable is no longer of type `MIDIAddress`, it's now of
 * type `Bankable::SingleAddress`. This is a bank-dependent address. The actual
 * `MIDIAddress` that's selected by the bank can be retrieved by calling
 * `address.getActiveAddress()`.
 * 
 * Knowing this, you should be able to understand most of the `update` method,
 * it's almost the same as the Custom-MIDI-Output-Element.ino example, except 
 * for the calls to `lock()` and `unlock()`.
 * 
 * To understand why these are necessary, consider what happens in the following
 * example without locking:
 * 
 * 1. The first bank is selected. This means that `address.getActiveAddress()`
 *    will return note C2.
 * 2. The user presses the button, a Note On event is sent for note C2.
 * 3. The button is still pressed, and the user selects the second bank:
 *    `address.getActiveAddress()` will now return note C3.
 * 4. The user releases the button, a Note Off event is sent for note C3.
 *    This is bad! The note C2 will keep on playing indefinitely, because we 
 *    never sent a Note Off event for that note. 
 * 
 * To fix this, we have to make sure that the Note Off events we send are always
 * sent to the same address as the previous Note On event. The address cannot
 * change in between Note On and Note Off events.
 * That's exactly what the `address.lock()` method does: it freezes the address.
 * After locking, `address.getActiveAddress()` will always return the same
 * address, until `address.unlock()` is called. When the address is unlocked,
 * `address.getActiveAddress()` will just return the address determined by the
 * selected bank.
